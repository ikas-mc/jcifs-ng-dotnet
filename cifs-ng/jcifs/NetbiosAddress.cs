	/// <b>About NetBIOS:</b> The NetBIOS name
	/// service is a dynamic distributed service that allows hosts to resolve
	/// names by broadcasting a query, directing queries to a server such as
	/// Samba or WINS. NetBIOS is currently the primary networking layer for
	/// providing name service, datagram service, and session service to the
	/// Microsoft Windows platform. A NetBIOS name can be 15 characters long
	/// and hosts usually registers several names on the network. From a
	/// Windows command prompt you can see
	/// what names a host registers with the nbtstat command.
